A structured, hands-on training program designed to equip students with essential bioinformatics skills, from foundational concepts to advanced analytical techniques.

## 📋 Program Overview

This repository hosts the curriculum, code, and resources for the Bioinformatics Training Program. The program is designed to be a comprehensive journey, blending theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on experience using real-world tools and datasets.

The overall roadmap and detailed course structure are outlined in the program guide:
[**bioinformatics-training-program.pdf**](./bioinformatics-training-program.pdf)

> **Note:** This is the master plan. Always refer to this PDF for the complete schedule, learning objectives, and module descriptions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the most out of this program, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone this Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/svermai/Bioinfo-training-2025-26.git
    cd Bioinfo-training-2025-26
    ```

2.  **Review the Program Guide:**
    The [program PDF](./bioinformatics-training-program.pdf) is your primary map. Familiarize yourself with the modules, timelines, and prerequisites.

3.  **Set Up Your Environment:**
    Each module may have specific software requirements (e.g., Python, R, Conda, specific bioinformatics tools). Check the module's dedicated folder for a `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, or setup instructions. We highly recommend using a package manager like [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage environments.

4.  **Follow the Modules in Order:**
    The curriculum is designed sequentially. Start with **Module 1** and progress through the materials, completing all exercises and assignments.
